/**
 * How this demo's UI wires to its backend — the frontend half of one session.
 *
 * A demo page needs two things to mint a session against the control plane: the
 * agent's Firestore id, and a publishable (`pk_`) key. Both come from Vite env
 * vars so no environment-specific id is baked into public source — a fresh
 * checkout is provisioned by setting them (see this app's `.env.example`). Vite
 * inlines `import.meta.env.*` at build, and those reads must be **static
 * literals**, so they're spelled out here.
 *
 * The workspace is not one of them: the `pk_` key belongs to exactly one, so the
 * control plane reads it off the key.
 *
 * `apiBase` is always `/api/v1`: in local dev Vite proxies it to the control
 * plane; in a deploy the apex domain that serves the demo UI rewrites `/api/*`
 * to the control plane. Either way the browser calls same-origin.
